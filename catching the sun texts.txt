catching the sun 1
}

submit yourself to your consciousness
seek to begin to love
to absorb soil
sugars, water, light growth
beginning and ending with the beginning
come to the world to feed 
to cherish and become with 
the moist bodies lapping in the waves of time

feeding bodies

Tissues connecting
Cells Dividing 
Osmosis
Morning dew absorbed in skin
Branches holding, swaying
sending waves to leaves and fruit
Birds come and search for food
Squirrels and birds eating fruit
Sharing time on earth
Giving and taking in order to survival
Only taking what they need and leaving the rest
None of it will go to waste. 
They will decompose
Chemical redistribution in order to proliferate

catching the sun

reciprocity
from photosythesis the light binds sugars to pass on her love
and possibly to make her seeds fall further than her nurturing limbs
nets of roots clumped in soil 
damp, they collect and store and release
and what a release when it falls towards the ground
but before it hits, a new body floating between them might soften the fall
skin aged with time accept these gifts graciously 
if not for you
then share 
give and love in return
